## Disavantages

The complete codebase, history included, is mirrored on every developers computer
Large repositories can cause:
- Slow initial clone/download of the repository
- Increased disk space requirements, especially when storing (large) binary files
- Slow performance if the repository contains a huge amount of files (think 50,000+)
- No locking mechanisms

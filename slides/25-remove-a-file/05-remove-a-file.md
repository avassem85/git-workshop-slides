## Lab: Delete a file

When we would like to delete a file in the repository, we take 5 steps: 

1. Make sure we have the latest version of the file(git pull) 
2. Delete the file `MyWebSite/spec/requestAllowance.feature` locally 
3. Let Git know about it(git add) 
4. Commit it locally(git commit -m "...") 
5. Push it to the repository(git push)
